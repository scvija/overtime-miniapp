            "contentHtml": "<p>Betting on the NFL games using crypto has recently become a better option for bettors than traditional betting platforms. Thanks to the same offering but a much more transparent user experience, you can now avoid bans and frozen winnings. Blockchain technology has made football betting more enjoyable. Here’s why that’s the case and how you can start betting on the NFL using crypto on Overtime. </p> <h2>What do I need to bet on the NFL using cryptocurrencies?</h2> <p>To bet on the NFL using crypto on Overtime, you need to connect your Ethereum wallet or a social profile. With the second option, you can use Gmail, Apple, GitHub, Twitter, or Discord. If you opt for this, your data will not be stored anywhere. The entire process takes a few seconds to complete. This is a big contrast compared to traditional betting platforms that store data centrally and make it available to third parties. <br /> <br />Once you’ve connected your wallet or social profile, you’ll need to fund your account. You can use cryptocurrencies or onramp funds using a credit card. Either way, you will need to have ETH deposited into your account on Optimism or Arbitrum to start betting. ETH or Ethereum is a cryptocurrency used to cover transaction costs. Optimism and Arbitrum are Ethereum chains that are much cheaper to use for transactions than Ethereum Mainnet. These transaction costs are negligible and usually amount to cents per each transaction, but it’s important to own a bit of it to get started on Overtime. <br> <br>Once again, here’s a step-by-step list of how to start using Overtime to bet on the NFL using crypto: </p> <ul> <li>Go to Overtime, one of the best crypto betting platforms using the URL www.overtimemarkets.xyz/markets.</li> <li>Connect a crypto wallet (Ethereum) or sign up using a social log in: Sign up using your email or link your social profile for instant access to the platform.</li> <li>Deposit funds, making sure you add ETH: Transfer your chosen cryptocurrency or stablecoins like USDT or USDC to your betting account. You can also use DAI, ARB, WETH, ETH, OP, and THALES.</li> <li>Place Your Bets: Navigate to the NFL section on the left, select a game or games, and choose your market to place your bets. You’ll see your ticket slip on the right.</li> <li>Click on ‘Approve‘ and then ‘Buy‘. Your bet has now been placed successfully! You can see it under the ‘Profile‘ section in the top navigation bar.</li> </ul> <p><br>In just a few steps, you can engage in online NFL crypto betting without the lengthy KYC processes that traditional sports betting sites require. <h2>What are the betting Markets for the NFL on Overtime</h2> <p>Betting on the NFL on Overtime includes tons of betting markets suitable for both casual fans and seasoned bettors. From moneyline and point spread bets to over/under totals and prop bets like rushing yards, and passing yards, there are a lot of options. You can also bet on kicking points, touchdowns, first- and second-half points, spreads, passing attempts, passing completions, extra points, longest receptions. <br> <br>The list goes on and new options are added to Overtime every week. With the rise of NFL crypto betting, you can place wagers on all of these markets using popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) stablecoins. If you use THALES, you can even get up to 2% improved odds per match added to parlay. That can make a huge difference for real value bettors. This flexibility improves your betting experience and allows you to experience excitement of betting on American football. <h2>How Does NFL Crypto Betting Work?</h2> <p>NFL crypto betting works similarly to traditional sports betting but offers unique advantages. By using digital currencies, transactions can be completed faster, often with lower fees. Bettors don’t need to provide personal information, enhancing privacy and security. Once you’ve placed your bets, winnings are deposited directly to your crypto wallet, making it convenient to manage your bankroll. There are no wagering requirements in place like in traditional platforms that require you to spend a certain amount before withdrawing. <h2>Don't miss out on the other great incentives on Overtime</h2> <p>Overtime regularly organizes kickbacks, dedicated rewards for the biggest sports events and leagues, and sportsbook competitions.You can use the <a href=\"https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/promotions\"> <u>promotions page</u> </a> to keep an eye out for ongoing and future goodies you can grab, as well as find out how to qualify and how your wallet is doing on various rewards leaderboards. </p> <h2>How are web2 and web3 betting platforms different?</h2> <p>Even though similar on the surface, web2 and web3 betting platforms are fundamentally different. <h3>KYC, registering, odds transparency</h3> <p>If you’ve never used a web2 sportsbook, you’ll be unpleasantly surprised by how long the signup process lasts and what info you’re required to provide. Sharing your ID or passport number is a must. That data, along with your playing history is then available to other financial institutions, such as banks, which can cause difficulties when applying for loans and other important processes in your life. <br> <br> Even without banks knowing about your history on sportsbook sites, do you feel comfortable sharing your highly sensitive data with an unknown entity? To a certain degree, it’s understandable that web2 sportsbooks want to do their due diligence and learn more about you. So does that mean you can learn a bit more about them and how they operate and set odds? Transparency on the other side is a bit of an issue in this case. Most web2 sportsbooks don’t have your best interest at heart and will shield how they come up with odds from you. <br> <br> Now let’s compare that to Overtime. Signing up requires no government-issued documents. All you need to do to become a user is connect your wallet. Alternatively, you can use a social login and sign up using your Twitter, Google, Apple, Discord, or Github account. All of this is done securely thanks to Overtime’s integration with Particle you can read about using the link in the previous sentence. You can onramp funds using your credit card or crypto wallet, but your data is not retained by any central entity. As far as odds are concerned, Overtime is as transparent as it gets. You can check out how odds are obtained from several industry-leading providers in our documentation. Overtime’s API is also open and available to anyone interested in what’s under the dApp’s hood. You won’t get nerfed odds or blacklisted for being curious. <h3>Being the house - liquidity pools</h3> <p>Someone might say that being friendly with your users is fine and dandy, but at the end of the day, it’s an ‘us vs. them’ scenario. If users win all the time, the sportsbook can’t continue to operate. Sportsbooks will always be on the opposing side of the user, right? Not necessarily. <br> <br>With Overtime, you can become a liquidity provider, meaning you essentially ‘become the house’, i.e. share a % of the PnL based on your contribution to the pool. You can see the liquidity pools’ lifetime PnL at any time. If Overtime wins, you win, and if it loses, you lose, too. Luckily though, historically the case has been that liquidity providers are making healthy profits. This means you don’t have to rely on just your betting strategy to make profits on Overtime. <h2>Most Popular Crypto for NFL Betting Online</h2> <p>When it comes to crypto betting NFL, several cryptocurrencies stand out: </p> <ul> <li>Ethereum (ETH): Known for its smart contract capabilities, making it a favorite for advanced bettors.</li> <li>Stablecoins (USDT, USDC): Ideal for those looking to avoid volatility while betting.</li> <li>THALES: A token launched by the Overtime team that gives you a 2% bonus per every match added to a parlay.</li> </ul><br> These options provide flexibility and choice for users on various NFL crypto betting sites. <h2>Why Do People Love NFL Crypto Betting?</h2> <p>The surge in NFL crypto betting popularity can be attributed to several factors: </p> <ul> <li>Anonymity: Bet without revealing personal information, ideal for privacy-conscious gamblers.</li> <li>Fast Transactions: Quick deposits and withdrawals enhance the betting experience.</li> <li>Global Accessibility: Users can bet from anywhere in the world without restrictions, making it a great option for online gambling.</li> <li>Potential for Bonuses: Many crypto sportsbooks, especially Overtime, offer lucrative additional bonuses, deposit bonuses, and free bets for using digital currencies. </li> </ul><br> These features make crypto NFL betting appealing to a broad audience. <h2>Key Factors to Check Before Selecting a Crypto NFL Betting Site</h2> <p>Before committing to a crypto NFL betting site, consider the following: </p> <ul> <li>Reputation: Read reviews and testimonials from other bettors.</li> <li>Payment Methods: Check for a variety of payment options, including different cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</li> <li>Withdrawal Policies: Understand the withdrawal limits and conditions to avoid surprises. </li> </ul><br>Doing your homework can help you find the best NFL crypto betting site for your needs. <h2>Key Features of NFL Crypto Betting Online Sportsbook</h2> <p>When selecting an NFL crypto betting online sportsbook, look for these key features: </p> <ul> <li>User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation ensures a smooth betting experience for you as a user.</li> <li>Variety of Betting Options: A wide range of bet types, including live betting, player props, and parlays.</li> <li>Security Measures: Look for sites that prioritize user security with encryption and secure wallet options.</li> <li>Customer Support: Reliable support through live chat, email, or social media to address any FAQs you might have.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.
