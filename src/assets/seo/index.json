Everything you do on the platform counts toward your total XP, your XP determines your rewards at the end of the season, and you can reach several levels/milestones to get THALES free bets throughout the year, along with other perks. In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP. The total rewards pool for this season is 100,000 OP and 200,000 ARB.</p> <h2>How does the Overdrop League work?</h2> <p>The Overdrop League lets you earn rewards and boost your earnings on Overtime by accumulating trading volume, maintaining usage streaks, using THALES as collateral, sharing your parlays on socials, building multi-game parlays, and collecting event- or sports-specific points modifiers! You can level up your way to 33,850 THALES and unlock many additional perks and bonuses along the way. Track your progress in the new Overdrop section of your profile in the navigation. The base calculation for your XP is calculated like this: Base XP = Buy-In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). In simpler terms, your wager gets more base XP the higher your buy-in and odds are. <br /><br />Buy-In in this case means the amount of $ that you placed as a Buy-In on the respective wager. Normalized Odds mean the odds of your wager shown in the format of a Normalized Probability between 0 and 1. For example, the Decimal Odds expression of 1.60 is 0.625 in the Normalized Odds format. You can boost your XP gains in the following way: </p> <ul> <li>Daily streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive day wagering on OT, up to 35%</li> <li>Weekly streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive week wagering on OT, up to 20%</li> <li>X Flex boost: An additional 10% XP for 3 days after sharing your parlay on X that can be reactivated after the booster expires</li> <li>Parlay boost: Up to 420% in additional XP based on how many games you add to your parlay</li> <li>THALES boost: 10% additional XP for using THALES as collateral for a specific wager/trade</li> <li>Loyalty boost: Up to 25% in permanent additional XP rewarded based on your level</li> </ul> <p><br />As you level up, you will receive a permanent XP boost for hitting the following levels: </p> <ul> <li>Level 1-5: 5% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 6-10: 10% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 11-15: 15% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 16-20: 20% XP Boost</li> </ul> <p><br />Throughout the season, you'll gradually unlock 33,850 THALES in free bets after hitting certain levels. Keep in mind that the free bets will be airdropped to your wallet on the first Friday after you level up to the required level. The free bets are divided up as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Level 4: 50 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 6: 200 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 8: 600 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 10: 1,500 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 12: 3,000 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 14: 4,500 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 16: 6,000 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 18: 8,000 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 20: 10,000 THALES Free Bet</li> </ul> <p><br />You can check out more details about the levels and rewards <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OvertimeMarkets.xyz/the-overdrop-league-cbff6c4b63b5\"><u>here</u></a>.
