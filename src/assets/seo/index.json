            "contentHtml": "<p>Betting on the NFL games using crypto has recently become a better option for bettors than traditional betting platforms. Thanks to the same offering but a much more transparent user experience, you can now avoid bans and frozen winnings. Blockchain technology has made football betting more enjoyable. Here’s why that’s the case and how you can start betting on the NFL using crypto on Overtime. </p> <h2>What do I need to bet on the NFL using cryptocurrencies?</h2> <p>To bet on the NFL using crypto on Overtime, you need to connect your Ethereum wallet or a social profile. With the second option, you can use Gmail, Apple, GitHub, Twitter, or Discord. If you opt for this, your data will not be stored anywhere. The entire process takes a few seconds to complete. This is a big contrast compared to traditional betting platforms that store data centrally and make it available to third parties. <br /> <br />Once you’ve connected your wallet or social profile, you’ll need to fund your account. You can use cryptocurrencies or onramp funds using a credit card. Either way, you will need to have ETH deposited into your account on Optimism or Arbitrum to start betting. ETH or Ethereum is a cryptocurrency used to cover transaction costs. Optimism and Arbitrum are Ethereum chains that are much cheaper to use for transactions than Ethereum Mainnet. These transaction costs are negligible and usually amount to cents per each transaction, but it’s important to own a bit of it to get started on Overtime. <br><br>Once again, here’s a step-by-step list of how to start using Overtime to bet on the NFL using crypto: </p> <ol> <li>Go to Overtime, one of the best crypto betting platforms using the URL www.overtimemarkets.xyz/markets.</li> <li>Connect a crypto wallet (Ethereum) or sign up using a social log in: Sign up using your email or link your social profile for instant access to the platform.</li> <li>Deposit funds, making sure you add ETH: Transfer your chosen cryptocurrency or stablecoins like USDT or USDC to your betting account. You can also use DAI, ARB, WETH, ETH, OP, and THALES.</li> <li>Place Your Bets: Navigate to the NFL section on the left, select a game or games, and choose your market to place your bets. You’ll see your ticket slip on the right.</li> <li>Click on ‘Approve‘ and then ‘Buy‘. Your bet has now been placed successfully! You can see it under the ‘Profile‘ section in the top navigation bar.</li> </ol> <p>In just a few steps, you can engage in online NFL crypto betting without the lengthy KYC processes that traditional sports betting sites require. <h2>What are the betting Markets for the NFL on Overtime</h2> <p>Betting on the NFL on Overtime includes tons of betting markets suitable for both casual fans and seasoned bettors. From moneyline and point spread bets to over/under totals and prop bets like rushing yards, and passing yards, there are a lot of options. You can also bet on kicking points, touchdowns, first- and second-half points, spreads, passing attempts, passing completions, extra points, longest receptions.<br><br>The list goes on and new options are added to Overtime every week. With the rise of NFL crypto betting, you can place wagers on all of these markets using popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) stablecoins.

Everything you do on the platform counts toward your total XP, your XP determines your rewards at the end of the season, and you can reach several levels/milestones to get THALES free bets throughout the year, along with other perks. In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP. The total rewards pool for this season is 100,000 OP and 200,000 ARB.</p> <h2>How does the Overdrop League work?</h2> <p>The Overdrop League lets you earn rewards and boost your earnings on Overtime by accumulating trading volume, maintaining usage streaks, using THALES as collateral, sharing your parlays on socials, building multi-game parlays, and collecting event- or sports-specific points modifiers! You can level up your way to 33,850 THALES and unlock many additional perks and bonuses along the way. Track your progress in the new Overdrop section of your profile in the navigation. The base calculation for your XP is calculated like this: Base XP = Buy-In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). In simpler terms, your wager gets more base XP the higher your buy-in and odds are. <br /><br />Buy-In in this case means the amount of $ that you placed as a Buy-In on the respective wager. Normalized Odds mean the odds of your wager shown in the format of a Normalized Probability between 0 and 1. For example, the Decimal Odds expression of 1.60 is 0.625 in the Normalized Odds format. You can boost your XP gains in the following way: </p> <ul> <li>Daily streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive day wagering on OT, up to 35%</li> <li>Weekly streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive week wagering on OT, up to 20%</li> <li>X Flex boost: An additional 10% XP for 3 days after sharing your parlay on X that can be reactivated after the booster expires</li> <li>Parlay boost: Up to 420% in additional XP based on how many games you add to your parlay</li> <li>THALES boost: 10% additional XP for using THALES as collateral for a specific wager/trade</li> <li>Loyalty boost: Up to 25% in permanent additional XP rewarded based on your level</li> </ul> <p><br />As you level up, you will receive a permanent XP boost for hitting the following levels: </p> <ul> <li>Level 1-5: 5% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 6-10: 10% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 11-15: 15% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 16-20: 20% XP Boost</li> </ul> <p><br />Throughout the season, you'll gradually unlock 33,850 THALES in free bets after hitting certain levels. Keep in mind that the free bets will be airdropped to your wallet on the first Friday after you level up to the required level. The free bets are divided up as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Level 4: 50 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 6: 200 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 8: 600 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 10: 1,500 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 12: 3,000 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 14: 4,500 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 16: 6,000 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 18: 8,000 THALES Free Bet</li> <li>Level 20: 10,000 THALES Free Bet</li> </ul> <p><br />You can check out more details about the levels and rewards <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OvertimeMarkets.xyz/the-overdrop-league-cbff6c4b63b5\"><u>here</u></a>.

The total rewards pool for this season is 100,000 OP and 200,000 ARB.</p> <h2>How does the Overdrop League work?</h2> <p>The Overdrop League lets you earn rewards and boost your earnings on Overtime by accumulating trading volume, maintaining usage streaks, using THALES as collateral, sharing your parlays on socials, building multi-game parlays, and collecting event- or sports-specific points modifiers! You can level up your way to 33,850 THALES and unlock many additional perks and bonuses along the way. Track your progress in the new Overdrop section of your profile in the navigation. The base calculation for your XP is calculated like this: Base XP = Buy-In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). In simpler terms, your wager gets more base XP the higher your buy-in and odds are. <br /><br />Buy-In in this case means the amount of $ that you placed as a Buy-In on the respective wager. Normalized Odds mean the odds of your wager shown in the format of a Normalized Probability between 0 and 1. For example, the Decimal Odds expression of 1.60 is 0.625 in the Normalized Odds format. You can boost your XP gains in the following way: </p> <ul> <li>Daily streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive day wagering on OT, up to 35%</li> <li>Weekly streaks: An additional 5% XP for every consecutive week wagering on OT, up to 20%</li> <li>X Flex boost: An additional 10% XP for 3 days after sharing your parlay on X that can be reactivated after the booster expires</li> <li>Parlay boost: Up to 420% in additional XP based on how many games you add to your parlay</li> <li>THALES boost: 10% additional XP for using THALES as collateral for a specific wager/trade</li> <li>Loyalty boost: Up to 25% in permanent additional XP rewarded based on your level</li> </ul> <p><br />As you level up, you will receive a permanent XP boost for hitting the following levels: </p> <ul> <li>Level 1-5: 5% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 6-10: 10% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 11-15: 15% XP Boost</li> <li>Level 16-20: 20% XP Boost</li> </ul> <p><br />Throughout the season, you'll gradually unlock 33,850 THALES in free bets after hitting certain levels.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.

In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP.

Everything you do on the platform counts toward your total XP, your XP determines your rewards at the end of the season, and you can reach several levels/milestones to get THALES free bets throughout the year, along with other perks. In other words, instead of for individual events, sports or leagues, you’ll now get OP and ARB rewards at the end of the season, in June 2025, distributed pro-rata based on your total XP. The total rewards pool for this season is 100,000 OP and 200,000 ARB.</p> <h2>How does the Overdrop League work?</h2> <p>The Overdrop League lets you earn rewards and boost your earnings on Overtime by accumulating trading volume, maintaining usage streaks, using THALES as collateral, sharing your parlays on socials, building multi-game parlays, and collecting event- or sports-specific points modifiers! You can level up your way to 33,850 THALES and unlock many additional perks and bonuses along the way. Track your progress in the new Overdrop section of your profile in the navigation. The base calculation for your XP is calculated like this: Base XP = Buy-In Amount * (2 - Normalized Odds). In simpler terms, your wager gets more base XP the higher your buy-in and odds are. <br /><br />Buy-In in this case means the amount of $ that you placed as a Buy-In on the respective wager. Normalized Odds mean the odds of your wager shown in the format of a Normalized Probability between 0 and 1. For example, the Decimal Odds expression of 1.60 is 0.625 in the Normalized Odds format.
