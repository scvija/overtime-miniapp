            "contentHtml": "<p>Betting on the NFL games using crypto has recently become a better option for bettors than traditional betting platforms. Thanks to the same offering but a much more transparent user experience, you can now avoid bans and frozen winnings. Blockchain technology has made football betting more enjoyable. Here’s why that’s the case and how you can start betting on the NFL using crypto on Overtime. </p> <h2>What do I need to bet on the NFL using cryptocurrencies?</h2> <p>To bet on the NFL using crypto on Overtime, you need to connect your Ethereum wallet or a social profile. With the second option, you can use Gmail, Apple, GitHub, Twitter, or Discord. If you opt for this, your data will not be stored anywhere. The entire process takes a few seconds to complete. This is a big contrast compared to traditional betting platforms that store data centrally and make it available to third parties. <br /> <br />Once you’ve connected your wallet or social profile, you’ll need to fund your account. You can use cryptocurrencies or onramp funds using a credit card. Either way, you will need to have ETH deposited into your account on Optimism or Arbitrum to start betting. ETH or Ethereum is a cryptocurrency used to cover transaction costs. Optimism and Arbitrum are Ethereum chains that are much cheaper to use for transactions than Ethereum Mainnet. These transaction costs are negligible and usually amount to cents per each transaction, but it’s important to own a bit of it to get started on Overtime. <br> <br>Once again, here’s a step-by-step list of how to start using Overtime to bet on the NFL using crypto: </p> <ul> <li>Go to Overtime, one of the best crypto betting platforms using the URL www.overtimemarkets.xyz/markets.</li> <li>Connect a crypto wallet (Ethereum) or sign up using a social log in: Sign up using your email or link your social profile for instant access to the platform.</li> <li>Deposit funds, making sure you add ETH: Transfer your chosen cryptocurrency or stablecoins like USDT or USDC to your betting account. You can also use DAI, ARB, WETH, ETH, OP, and THALES.</li> <li>Place Your Bets: Navigate to the NFL section on the left, select a game or games, and choose your market to place your bets. You’ll see your ticket slip on the right.</li> <li>Click on ‘Approve‘ and then ‘Buy‘. Your bet has now been placed successfully! You can see it under the ‘Profile‘ section in the top navigation bar.</li> </ul> <p> <br>In just a few steps, you can engage in online NFL crypto betting without the lengthy KYC processes that traditional sports betting sites require. <h2>What are the betting Markets for the NFL on Overtime</h2> <p>Betting on the NFL on Overtime includes tons of betting markets suitable for both casual fans and seasoned bettors. From moneyline and point spread bets to over/under totals and prop bets like rushing yards, and passing yards, there are a lot of options. You can also bet on kicking points, touchdowns, first- and second-half points, spreads, passing attempts, passing completions, extra points, longest receptions. <br> <br>The list goes on and new options are added to Overtime every week. With the rise of NFL crypto betting, you can place wagers on all of these markets using popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) stablecoins. If you use THALES, you can even get up to 2% improved odds per match added to parlay. That can make a huge difference for real value bettors. This flexibility improves your betting experience and allows you to experience excitement of betting on American football. <h2>How Does NFL Crypto Betting Work?</h2> <p>NFL crypto betting works similarly to traditional sports betting but offers unique advantages. By using digital currencies, transactions can be completed faster, often with lower fees. Bettors don’t need to provide personal information, enhancing privacy and security. Once you’ve placed your bets, winnings are deposited directly to your crypto wallet, making it convenient to manage your bankroll. There are no wagering requirements in place like in traditional platforms that require you to spend a certain amount before withdrawing. <h2>How are web2 and web3 betting platforms different?</h2> <p>Even though similar on the surface, web2 and web3 betting platforms are fundamentally different. <h3>KYC, registering, odds transparency</h3> <p>If you’ve never used a web2 sportsbook, you’ll be unpleasantly surprised by how long the signup process lasts and what info you’re required to provide. Sharing your ID or passport number is a must. That data, along with your playing history is then available to other financial institutions, such as banks, which can cause difficulties when applying for loans and other important processes in your life. <br> <br> Even without banks knowing about your history on sportsbook sites, do you feel comfortable sharing your highly sensitive data with an unknown entity? To a certain degree, it’s understandable that web2 sportsbooks want to do their due diligence and learn more about you. So does that mean you can learn a bit more about them and how they operate and set odds? Transparency on the other side is a bit of an issue in this case. Most web2 sportsbooks don’t have your best interest at heart and will shield how they come up with odds from you. <br> <br> Now let’s compare that to Overtime. Signing up requires no government-issued documents. All you need to do to become a user is connect your wallet. Alternatively, you can use a social login and sign up using your Twitter, Google, Apple, Discord, or Github account. All of this is done securely thanks to Overtime’s integration with Particle you can read about using the link in the previous sentence. You can onramp funds using your credit card or crypto wallet, but your data is not retained by any central entity. As far as odds are concerned, Overtime is as transparent as it gets. You can check out how odds are obtained from several industry-leading providers in our documentation. Overtime’s API is also open and available to anyone interested in what’s under the dApp’s hood. You won’t get nerfed odds or blacklisted for being curious. <h3>Being the house - liquidity pools</h3> <p>Someone might say that being friendly with your users is fine and dandy, but at the end of the day, it’s an ‘us vs. them’ scenario. If users win all the time, the sportsbook can’t continue to operate. Sportsbooks will always be on the opposing side of the user, right? Not necessarily. <br> <br>With Overtime, you can become a liquidity provider, meaning you essentially ‘become the house’, i.e. share a % of the PnL based on your contribution to the pool. You can see the liquidity pools’ lifetime PnL at any time. If Overtime wins, you win, and if it loses, you lose, too. Luckily though, historically the case has been that liquidity providers are making healthy profits. This means you don’t have to rely on just your betting strategy to make profits on Overtime. <h2>Most Popular Crypto for NFL Betting Online</h2> <p>When it comes to crypto betting NFL, several cryptocurrencies stand out: </p> <ul> <li>Ethereum (ETH): Known for its smart contract capabilities, making it a favorite for advanced bettors.</li> <li>Stablecoins (USDT, USDC): Ideal for those looking to avoid volatility while betting.</li> <li>THALES: A token launched by the Overtime team that gives you a 2% bonus per every match added to a parlay.</li> </ul> <br> These options provide flexibility and choice for users on various NFL crypto betting sites. <h2>Why Do People Love NFL Crypto Betting?</h2> <p>The surge in NFL crypto betting popularity can be attributed to several factors: </p> <ul> <li>Anonymity: Bet without revealing personal information, ideal for privacy-conscious gamblers.</li> <li>Fast Transactions: Quick deposits and withdrawals enhance the betting experience.</li> <li>Global Accessibility: Users can bet from anywhere in the world without restrictions, making it a great option for online gambling.</li> <li>Potential for Bonuses: Many crypto sportsbooks, especially Overtime, offer lucrative additional bonuses, deposit bonuses, and free bets for using digital currencies. </li> </ul> <br> These features make crypto NFL betting appealing to a broad audience. <h2>Key Factors to Check Before Selecting a Crypto NFL Betting Site</h2> <p>Before committing to a crypto NFL betting site, consider the following: </p> <ul> <li>Reputation: Read reviews and testimonials from other bettors.</li> <li>Payment Methods: Check for a variety of payment options, including different cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</li> <li>Withdrawal Policies: Understand the withdrawal limits and conditions to avoid surprises. </li> </ul> <br>Doing your homework can help you find the best NFL crypto betting site for your needs. <h2>Key Features of NFL Crypto Betting Online Sportsbook</h2> <p>When selecting an NFL crypto betting online sportsbook, look for these key features: </p> <ul> <li>User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation ensures a smooth betting experience for you as a user.</li> <li>Variety of Betting Options: A wide range of bet types, including live betting, player props, and parlays.</li> <li>Security Measures: Look for sites that prioritize user security with encryption and secure wallet options.</li> <li>Customer Support: Reliable support through live chat, email, or social media to address any FAQs you might have.

            "contentHtml": "<p> NHL prop bets have become a go-to option for sports bettors looking for exciting ways to wager on NHL games. Whether you’re targeting individual player performances, team matchups, or game-specific stats, NHL prop betting provides a wide range of markets. From shots on goal and assists to anytime goal scorer wagers, there’s something for every bettor looking for value. </p> <p> Let’s dive into strategies, best NHL player props, and top sportsbooks offering the best odds during the NHL regular season and beyond. </p> <h2> What Are NHL Prop Bets? </h2> <p> NHL prop bets, short for proposition bets, allow bettors to wager on specific outcomes unrelated to the final score. These include: </p> <ul> <li> NHL player props: Examples include betting on Connor McDavid to score, Nathan MacKinnon for over/under shots on goal, or goalies like those from the Colorado Avalanche achieving a set number of saves. </li> <li> Team props: Wagers such as power-play goals, total team goals, or puck-line outcomes. </li> <li> Game props: Betting on events like the first team to score, total penalties, or period-specific results. </li> </ul> <h2> Top NHL Prop Betting Markets </h2> <ol> <li> Anytime Goal Scorer <br/> This is one of the most popular prop picks. Superstars like Connor McDavid and emerging scorers provide high-value opportunities during marquee matchups. </li> <li> Shots on Goal <br/> Betting on player shots is a great way to focus on aggressive forwards and their role in the lineups. This market is often seen in top online sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings. </li> <li> Assists and Points Props <br/> These props target players known for setting up scoring chances. Look for elite playmakers on teams like the Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, or the Red Wings. </li> <li> Goaltender Props <br/> Goalies are critical in prop betting. You can wager on saves, shutouts, or goals allowed, particularly when betting on elite performers. </li> <li> Power Play Performance <br/> Teams with strong power-play units offer value in betting on power-play goals or opportunities. </li> </ol> <h2> Best Sportsbooks for NHL Prop Bets </h2> <p> Here are the leading sportsbooks offering NHL odds and prop markets: </p> <ul> <li> Overtime Markets: Offers the same player prop bets found in web 2 sportsbooks, but without their limitations such as freezing funds or banning players. </li> <li> DraftKings: Known for its expansive NHL markets, including NHL player prop bets and live betting options. Use a promo code for bonus offers. </li> <li> FanDuel: Offers competitive odds on puck line, moneyline, and props like shots on goal and assists. </li> <li> BetMGM: Features generous bonus bets and promotions for new and experienced bettors. </li> <li> Caesars: Offers reliable betting odds for NHL matchups, including unique individual player props. </li> </ul> <h2> NHL Prop Betting Tips </h2> <ol> <li> Focus on Matchups: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each team. For example, the Ducks may struggle defensively, while teams like the Rangers or Avalanche can exploit these gaps. </li> <li> Track NHL Rankings: Check offensive and defensive rankings to identify prop opportunities. A team with a weak power play or a goalie in poor form is worth targeting. </li> <li> Look at Regular Season Trends: Pay attention to consistent player performances in goals, assists, and shots throughout the season. </li> <li> Parlay Smart: Combining props like anytime goal scorer and team props can boost your payout, but be cautious of high-risk combinations. </li> <li> Stay Updated on Lineups: Injuries to star players can drastically shift betting odds. </li> </ol> <h2> NHL Prop Bets: FAQs </h2> <h2> What are the best NHL player props to bet on? </h2> <p> Popular props include shots on goal, anytime goal scorer, saves for goalies, and total points for players like Nathan MacKinnon or Connor McDavid. </p> <h2> Which sportsbooks offer the best NHL odds? </h2> <p> Top sportsbooks include DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM.

Bettors can even explore apps like PrizePicks and Underdog for innovative prop picks. To get the best of both worlds, your best bet (pun intended) is Overtime Markets. Overtime offers all the NBA prop bets you can find with web2 bookies - the only difference being is that you can’t get banned and your winnings don’t get frozen. </p> <h2> Best NBA Prop Bets Today </h2> <p> If you’re hunting for the best NBA player props, look for high-value matchups. For example, a game between the Knicks and Rockets could feature interesting prop bets on rebounds or steals. The Nuggets Nikola Jokic’s dominance on the court also opens up opportunities for NBA picks focused on his stats. </p> Popular prop categories include: <br><br> <ul> <li> Points scored: Bet on whether a player exceeds a points threshold. </li> <li> Rebounds (REB): Predict total rebounds by players like Jokic or AD. </li> <li> Assists (AST): Target key playmakers such as DeRozan or Luka. </li> <li> Steals and blocks (STL, BLK): A great option for defensive specialists. </li> </ul> <h2> Top Sportsbooks for NBA Prop Betting </h2> <p> The best sportsbooks offer competitive odds, bonus bets, and seamless apps for NBA prop betting. Here are some platforms to consider: </p> <h3> Overtime Markets </h3> <p> Offers the best odds in the world if you use the platform-native THALES as collateral.

If you're a sports bettor looking to dive into the world of NBA betting, you can bet on the regular season or the playoffs in just a few seconds! Here’s a quick guide on how to get started: </p> <ul> <li>Choose a Crypto Sportsbook: Look for a reputable crypto sportsbook that accepts popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and other digital currencies. Make sure the platform offers user-friendly features and competitive odds. Overtime does all of this and more, as using THALES on the platform gives you a 2% boost in winnings per match added to your parlay. This effectively means much better odds than anywhere else. </li> <li>Create an Account: Sign up and create your account. Many betting platforms allow you to register without KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, making it easier for new players. Overtime requires you to connect your Ethereum wallet or social profile like Gmail, Apple, GitHub, Twitter, or Discord. The entire process takes just a few seconds and is incredibly simple. This is not the case with 99% of other bookies. </li> <li> Deposit Funds: Fund your account using your preferred cryptocurrency. Most platforms have low transaction fees and offer a deposit bonus for new players. Alternatively, you can also use traditional banking methods like credit cards. Either way, to use a platform built on Ethereum like Overtime, you will need ETH deposited to your wallet on either Optimism or Arbitrum, the two supported L2 networks. </li> <li> Explore Betting Options: Once your account is funded, navigate through the various betting markets. You can choose from moneyline bets, point spread, prop bets, and in-play (live betting) options during the game. </li> <li> Place Bets: After deciding which market to bet on, enter your wager amount and confirm your bet. Click on ‘Approve‘ and then ‘Buy‘. It’s as simple as that! </li> </ul> <h2> What NBA Markets Can You Bet on with Crypto? </h2> When it comes to NBA betting, there are various markets to explore: <ul> <li>Moneyline Bets: Bet on which team will win the game outright. </li> <li>Point Spread: Wager on the margin of victory. For example, if a team is favored by 5 points, they must win by more than that margin for your bet to win. </li> <li>Prop Bets: Bet on specific events within the game, such as player performance or total points scored. </li> <li>In-Play Betting: Place bets while the game is ongoing, allowing you to take advantage of changing dynamics and odds. </li> <li>Parlays: Combine multiple bets for potentially higher payouts but with increased risk. Overtime often runs betting competition which can drastically boost your parlay winnings. </li> </ul> <h2> Why Use Crypto to Bet on the NBA? </h2> Using cryptocurrencies for sports betting offers several advantages: <ul> <li>Speed: Crypto transactions are processed almost instantly, allowing for quick deposits and withdrawals.

This is especially true for Overtime. </li> <li>Range of Sports: In addition to the NBA, you can use crypto to bet on a variety of sports, including esports, NCAA basketball, and more. </li> </ul> <h2> Is NBA Betting Legal? </h2>The legality of NBA betting varies by location.

Enjoy the thrill of the game while making the most of your betting experience! <h2> Basketball Betting and Overtime FAQs </h2> <h2> What is a Moneyline Bet? </h2> <p> A moneyline bet is the simplest form of basketball wagering. You just pick the team you believe will win the game outright. Odds indicate the likelihood of each team winning, with favorites offering smaller payouts and underdogs offering higher ones. </p> <h2> How Does Point Spread Betting Work? </h2> <p> Point spread betting adds a handicap, or “spread,” that the favored team must cover to win the bet. For example, if the spread is 7 points, the favorite must win by more than 7 for your bet to pay out. If they win by exactly 7, it’s a push, and your stake is refunded. Some spreads use half-points (e.g., 7.5) to prevent a push. </p> <h2> What Are Over/Under (Totals) Bets? </h2> <p> Over/under bets, also called totals, focus on the combined score of both teams. You bet on whether the total points will be over or under a predetermined number, regardless of which team wins. You can also bet on totals for individual teams, quarters, or halves. </p> <h2> What Are Prop Bets? </h2> <p> Prop bets, or proposition bets, involve wagering on specific events or performances during the game. These bets can cover a wide range of possibilities, such as how many points a player will score or whether a team will hit a certain number of three-pointers. They add excitement by focusing on aspects that might not affect the game’s final outcome. </p> <h2> What Is Live/In-Game Betting? </h2> <p> Live or in-game betting allows you to place wagers on a game while it’s happening. The odds and lines continuously change in real-time based on the flow of the game, giving bettors the chance to adjust their bets as the action unfolds. </p> <h2> What does +1.5 mean in basketball betting? </h2> <p> The +1.5 indicates the point spread. The team is an underdog and can lose by 1 point or win the game for your bet to win. </p> <h2> What do I need to play on Overtime? </h2> <p> All you need to play on Overtime Markets is a crypto wallet or you can generate a new one on Overtime using social login such as Gmail, Apple, GitHub, Twitter, or Discord.

Here are some key features: </p> <ul> <li> Fast deposits and withdrawals with Ethereum, stablecoins, and other currencies. </li> <li> Betting lines for every MLB game, including the moneyline, run line, and point spreads. </li> <li> Live betting options for both the American League and National League games. </li> <li> Bets on events like the World Series or individual player performances. </li> <li> Bonuses and promotions, such as betting competitions, free bets, or welcome bonus for new users. </li> <li> A variety of betting markets for other professional baseball leagues, including the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). </li> </ul> <h2> Who Are the MLB World Series Favorites in 2024? </h2> <p> The 2024 MLB season is packed with excitement, and a few teams stand out as World Series favorites: </p> <ul> <li> LA Dodgers: Shohei Ohtani. Need we say more? </li> <li> Atlanta Braves: Dominating the regular season with stellar pitching and power-hitters. </li> <li> Arizona Diamondbacks: A surprise contender, especially after their impressive run in the playoffs. </li> <li> Houston Astros: Always dangerous in the postseason, the Astros aim for another title. </li> <li> New York Yankees: Even though they've had ups and downs, they remain a threat in the American League. </li> <li> Boston Red Sox: With solid MLB odds, they could make a deep playoff push. </li> </ul> <p> Betting on underdogs can also yield great returns, especially in tight matchups where the moneyline shifts dramatically. </p> <h2> What to Consider When Betting on Major League Baseball </h2> <ul> <li> Baseball betting can be unpredictable, so it’s essential to factor in these considerations: </li> <li> Pitching matchups: The starting pitcher can heavily influence the outcome. </li> <li> Home and away performance: Teams like the Yankees and Braves are often stronger at home. </li> <li> Injuries and fatigue: Late in the season, player health becomes a critical factor. </li> <li> Weather conditions: Outdoor games can be affected by weather, influencing total runs or the likelihood of a home run. </li> <li> Recent form: A team’s performance in the last few MLB games can offer insight into future results. </li> </ul> <h2> Other Baseball Betting Tips and Strategies </h2> <p> Here are some additional tips for being a more successful MLB bettor. </p> <h2> Analyze Starting Pitchers </h2> <p> Starting pitchers are crucial to the outcome of baseball games. Be sure to study who’s on the mound for each team and evaluate their past performance. A dominant starter can give their team a significant edge, while a struggling one might leave them at a disadvantage. </p> <h2> Assess Bullpen Strength </h2> <p> After the starter leaves the game, the bullpen becomes critical, especially in later innings. Review bullpen stats to identify which teams are better equipped to close out games. A strong bullpen can secure early leads. </p> <h2> Factor in Home/Road Splits </h2> <p> Some teams excel at home but struggle on the road, and vice versa. Check each team’s home and away records to uncover patterns that might influence your bets. For instance, if the San Diego Padres are missing a key player or pitcher, it could severely impact their performance, especially in away games. </p> <h2> Study Historical Matchups </h2> <p> Certain teams and pitchers have consistent trends when facing specific opponents. Analyzing past matchups can provide insight into future results. For example, the New York Yankees have historically dominated the Minnesota Twins, winning 110 out of their 170 games since 1993. This kind of historical trend could offer valuable clues. </p> <h2> Monitor Fatigue Levels </h2> <p> The long MLB season takes a toll on teams, and fatigue can become a decisive factor, especially during grueling stretches late in the season. Pay attention to how frequently teams have been playing, as tired players may underperform. </p> <h2> Evaluate Run Differential </h2> <p> Run differential, or the gap between runs scored and allowed, is a reliable indicator of a team’s overall strength. Teams with a positive run differential are often legitimate contenders, while those with negative numbers might be overachieving or struggling more than their record shows. Use this metric to guide your predictions. </p> <h2> Find Value in Underdogs </h2> <p> Underdogs are often overlooked but can provide excellent betting value, particularly in matchups where an upset is possible. Betting on a team with longer odds can pay off handsomely if they manage to surprise the favorites. Always keep an eye out for these opportunities when evaluating betting lines. </p> <h2> Getting Started: How to Bet on Major League Baseball 2024 with Crypto </h2> <ul> <li> Choose a sportsbook: Select an online sportsbook that supports crypto betting and offers a wide variety of MLB betting options. </li> <li> Create a crypto wallet: Use a crypto wallet to store your funds and make quick transactions. </li> <li> Deposit funds: Transfer Ethereum, Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies to your sportsbook account. </li> <li> Explore betting markets: Browse through moneyline bets, parlays, prop bets, and other betting options for your chosen game. </li> <li> Place your bet: Select the team or player you want to back, confirm your bet, and enjoy the betting experience! </li> <li> Withdraw winnings: If your bet is successful, you can withdraw your profits to your crypto wallet instantly.
