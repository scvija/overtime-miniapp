This will give you the amount of reward per point. The formula incentivizes positions with lower odds and higher volume, so the bigger you go, the more rewards you’ll get. The best part? You <strong>don’t really need to calculate</strong> all of this yourself. <br> <br>You can follow your progress and see your rewards grow using Dune, all transparently and easily accessible. <strong>Track your rewards: </strong> </span> <a href='https://dune.com/leifu/overtime-big-leagues-campaign-23-24' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Dune dashboard</u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> </p> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 1: Low Odds with Low Volume </span> </span> </span> </h3> <span> <span> <span>Say you have a parlay with the following implied Odds (X): 0.2 (20% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $500. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.2/2) * 500 = <strong>450 points</strong>. </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 2: High Odds with High Volume </span> </span> </span> <br /> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In this case, your implied Odds are (X): 0.8 (80% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $5000. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.8/2) * 5000 = <strong>3000 points</strong>. </span> </span> </span> </p> <span> <span></span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span></span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 3 (Adding up your tickets total points) </span> </span> </span> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In example 3, we will demonstrate how parlay totals are added together. Your first parlay has implied Odds (X): 0.6 and the trading Volume (V) is $800. This gives you a total of: Pn = (1–0.6/2) * 800 = <strong>560 points</strong>. <br> <br>The other parlay has Odds of 0.4 with $1200 in volume, leading to (1–0.4/2) * 1200 = <strong>960 points</strong>. <br> <br> Add those up and you get 960+560 = <strong>1520 points.</strong> </span> </span> <span> <br> <br> Remember that parlays involving multiple incentivized leagues will be treated separately in each ranking. <br> <br> For example, a parlay ticket that includes games from the EPL, NBA, and NFL will be counted in each of the three leaderboards, somewhat acting as a 3x multiplier. If the ticket involves games from two leagues, it will be counted twice in the corresponding leaderboards </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>SportsAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> and </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>ParlayAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span>.</span> </span> </span> </p> <p> <hr><h2> <span> End-of-Season Reward Distribution </span> </h2> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Your hard-earned rewards will be distributed at the end of each respective season.

Here is how Gamified Staking Rewards work: </span> </span> </span> </p> <h2> <span> <span> <span>Trading Volume Points</span> </span> </span> </h2> <p> <span> <span> <span>Trading Volume points are accrued by driving trading volume through <a href='https://thalesmarket.io/markets' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Thales Markets</u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> and Overtime Markets. For every 1 USD of volume driven across Thales products, you get 1 point. This means that your total points from Trading Volume are equal to the sum of your total USD Trading Volume from Thales Markets and Overtime Markets (multiplied by 1).</span> </span> </span> </p> <h2> <span> <span> <span>AMM LP Points</span> </span> </span> </h2> <p> <span> <span> <span>AMM LP points are accrued by depositing USD into various AMM Liquidity Pools across Thales products (including <a href='https://thalesmarket.io/liquidity-pool' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Thales AMM Pool, </u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> <a href='https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/liquidity-pool?lang=en&pool-type=single' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>SportsAMM pool, </u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> <a href='https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/liquidity-pool?lang=en&pool-type=parlay' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>ParlayAMM pool, </u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> etc.). <br><br>For each 1 USD deposited into a LP pool you get 0.1 points. This means that your total points from AMM LP-ing are equal to the sum of your total USD deposits from Thales Markets and Overtime Markets LP pools, multiplied by 0.1. </span> </span> </p> <h2> <span> <span> <span>Vaults points</span> </span> </span> </h2> <p> <span> <span> <span> Vaults Points are accrued by depositing USD into various Vaults across Thales products (including<a href='https://thalesmarket.io/vaults' target='_blank'><span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Thales Market Vaults, </u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> and <a href='https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/vaults' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Overtime Markets Vaults</u></strong> </span> </span> </span> </a>). Vaults offer a mechanism for automatic trading, i.e. buying positions when certain conditions are met (for example, buying positions with 75% odds of winning and any discount).<br><br> For each 1 USD deposited into a Vault, you get 0.2 points. This means that your total points from Vaults deposits are equal to the sum of your total Vaults USD deposits, multiplied by 0.2. </span> </span> </span> </p> <h2> <span> <span> <span>THALES Staked Multiplier</span> </span> </span> <span> </span> </h2> <span>The amount of THALES you have staked determines the multiplier for your total points. The more THALES you stake, the higher the final multiplier of your total points. THALESStakedMultiplier = 1 + UserThalesStaked /{StakingDivider} THALES Staked Multiplier minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 2. <br><br> Your final points that determine your share of THALES Gamified Staking Bonus rewards is equal to the sum of all your accrued points multiplied by the THALES Staked Multiplier. Total Points = (Trading Volume points + AMM LP points + Vaults Points) x THALES Staked Multiplier </span> <hr> <h2> <span> <span> <span>Don’t miss out on the other great incentives on Overtime</span> </span> </span> </h2> <p> <span>Overtime regularly organizes kickbacks, dedicated rewards for the biggest sports events and leagues, and sportsbook competitions. <br> <br>You can use the <a href='https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/promotions'> <u>promotions page</u> </a> to keep an eye out for ongoing and future goodies you can grab, as well as find out how to qualify and how your wallet is doing on the various rewards leaderboards. </span> </span> </span> </p>"
