This will give you the amount of reward per point. The formula incentivizes positions with lower odds and higher volume, so the bigger you go, the more rewards you’ll get. The best part? You <strong>don’t really need to calculate</strong> all of this yourself. <br> <br>You can follow your progress and see your rewards grow using Dune, all transparently and easily accessible. <strong>Track your rewards: </strong> </span> <a href='https://dune.com/leifu/overtime-big-leagues-campaign-23-24' target='_blank'> <span> <span> <span> <strong> <u>Dune dashboard</u> </strong> </span> </span> </span> </a> </p> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 1: Low Odds with Low Volume </span> </span> </span> </h3> <span> <span> <span>Say you have a parlay with the following implied Odds (X): 0.2 (20% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $500. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.2/2) * 500 = <strong>450 points</strong>. </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 2: High Odds with High Volume </span> </span> </span> <br /> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In this case, your implied Odds are (X): 0.8 (80% chance of winning) and your trading Volume (V) is $5000. The calculation would be as follows: Pn = (1–0.8/2) * 5000 = <strong>3000 points</strong>. </span> </span> </span> </p> <span> <span></span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span> <span></span> </span> </span> <h3> <span> <span> <span>Example 3 (Adding up your tickets total points) </span> </span> </span> </h3> <p> <span> <span> <span>In example 3, we will demonstrate how parlay totals are added together. Your first parlay has implied Odds (X): 0.6 and the trading Volume (V) is $800. This gives you a total of: Pn = (1–0.6/2) * 800 = <strong>560 points</strong>. <br> <br>The other parlay has Odds of 0.4 with $1200 in volume, leading to (1–0.4/2) * 1200 = <strong>960 points</strong>. <br> <br> Add those up and you get 960+560 = <strong>1520 points.</strong> </span> </span> <span> <br> <br> Remember that parlays involving multiple incentivized leagues will be treated separately in each ranking. <br> <br> For example, a parlay ticket that includes games from the EPL, NBA, and NFL will be counted in each of the three leaderboards, somewhat acting as a 3x multiplier. If the ticket involves games from two leagues, it will be counted twice in the corresponding leaderboards </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>SportsAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> and </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> <strong>ParlayAMM</strong> </span> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span>.</span> </span> </span> </p> <p> <hr><h2> <span> End-of-Season Reward Distribution </span> </h2> </span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Your hard-earned rewards will be distributed at the end of each respective season.
